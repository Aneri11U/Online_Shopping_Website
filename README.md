# Online_Shopping_Website
This project is an e-commerce website that allows users to purchase laptops. 
To order a laptop, users must log in to their existing account or create a new one if it's their first time ordering. Users can select from the available laptop options and add them to cart. The cart will contain the clear all option. 

This online laptop shopping website uses front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
Here, for the register and log-in page, I have used local storage. In this project, I have utilized CSS for animation, transition effects, and hover effects. Form validation is done through JavaScript. 

This is the homepage of the website:

From this page, one can go to register page and register, the data of user will be stored in the local storage.
